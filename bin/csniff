=head1 NAME

csniff - Command line interface to C<Class::Sniff> graphs.

=head1 USAGE

 csniff [options] dir

=head1 OPTIONS

Boolean options:

 -v,  --verbose     Print what classes are being loaded
 -p,  --png         Output as png (requires 'dot' executable)
 -g,  --gif         Output as gif (requires 'dot' executable)
 -t,  --text        Output as text (large graphs may not render well)

Options that take arguments:

 -n,  --namespace   Perl regex to match desired namespaces
 -i,  --ignore      Perl regex to exclude namespaces
 -I,                Use this path with "use lib".        

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Given a directory, attempts to render a C<Class::Sniff> graph for all modules
found in it.  This may be very slow.  Be patient.  Output is sent to STDOUT,
so redirect it where you will.

If no C<namespace> argument is passed, it will attempt to graph every
namespace.  Because some of the modules C<Class::Sniff> must load are fairly
heavyweight, you will get plenty of modules showing up in the graph which you
didn't expect.  And it will be slow.  Did I mention that already?

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Graph your C<DBIx::Class> resultset objects

You have a bunch of C<DBIx::Class> resultset objects, but you don't want to
see the C<DBIx::Class> hierarchy.

As text graph:

 csniff --namespace '^My::ResultSet' --ignore '^DBIx' \
    lib/My/ResultSet > rs.txt

As text graph with short options:

 csniff -n '^My::Resultset' -i '^DBIx' lib/My/ResultSet > rx.txt

As PNG:

 csniff -n '^My::Resultset' -i '^DBIx' --png lib/My/ResultSet > rx.png

As Gif:

 csniff -n '^My::Resultset' -i '^DBIx' --gif lib/My/ResultSet > rx.gif

Note that the C<--gif> and C<--png> options require that you have the
C<dot> executable installed and in your C<PATH>.  C<dot> is part of the
GraphViz package (L<http://www.graphviz.org/>).
