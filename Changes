Revision history for Class-Sniff

0.08_03 20/05/2009
        - Add -I switch for csniff utility.
        - Removed dependency on Sub::Information.  That has a dependency on
          Data::Dump::Streamer and that module fails its tests for non-US
          locales.

0.08_02 19/03/2009
        - Add C<csniff> command-line utility.
        - Add 'clean' option to constructor to avoid tracking pseudo-packages.
        - Added C<graph_from_namespace> as everyone seems to want this.

0.08_01 unreleased
        - Added experimental code to detect "fake" packages.  Ideas offered by
          Graham Barr, but abused by me.  They're not his fault!
        - OUCH!  Added the code smell and regression tests to the MANIFEST.
          Would no wonder all tests are passing on the CPAN :)
        - Clarified that "long methods" may not really be a code smell at all.
          Doc changes don't really need to be here, but this is important
          enough to mention it.
        - new_from_namespace now can accept a regex, too.

0.08    15/02/2009
        - Added 'new_from_namespace' method.

0.07    15/02/2009
        - combine_graphs method added.  Now it's trivial to see inheritance
          hierarchies.
        - Allow an instance of an object to be passed to the constructor, not
          just a class name.
        - Removed the 'tree' representation. Code is much easier to read as a
          result.

0.06    03/02/2009
        - Experimental 'method length' support.
        - Circular paths are now a fatal error.

0.05    02/02/2009
        - Added experimental support for tracking duplicate methods.
        - Started documentation reorganization.

0.04    02/02/2009
        - Added 'exported' to detect exported 'methods'.
        - Added "report" method to create a simple, human-readable report.
        - Added "build_path" fix from Aristotle.

0.03    01/02/2009
        - Added 'multiple_inheritance' method.
        - Added support for including the "UNIVERSAL" class.

0.02    01/02/2009
        - Added documentation.
        - Made the 'unreachable' return more sane.

0.01    01/02/2009
        - First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
