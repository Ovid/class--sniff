=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Class::Sniff;
 my $sniff = Class::Sniff->new({class => 'Some::class'});

 my $num_methods = $sniff->methods;
 my $num_classes = $sniff->classes;
 my @methods     = $sniff->methods;
 my @classes     = $sniff->classes;

 my $graph    = $sniff->graph;   # Graph::Easy
 my $graphviz = $graph->as_graphviz();
 open my $DOT, '|dot -Tpng -o graph.png' or die("Cannot open pipe to dot: $!");
 print $DOT $graphviz;

 print $sniff->to_string;
 my @unreachable = $sniff->unreachable;
 foreach my $method (@unreachable) {
     print "$method\n";
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ALPHA> code.  You've been warned.

The interface is rather ad-hoc at the moment and is likely to change.  After
creating a new instance, calling the C<report> method is your best option.
You can then visually examine it to look for potential problems:

 my $sniff = Class::Sniff->new({class => 'Some::Class'});
 print $sniff->report;

This module attempts to help programmers find 'code smells' in the
object-oriented code.  If it reports something, it does not mean that your
code is wrong.  It just means that you might want to look at your code a
little bit more closely to see if you have any problems.

At the present time, we assume Perl's default left-most, depth-first search
order.  We may alter this in the future (and there's a work-around with the
C<paths> method.  More on this later).

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 C<new>

 my $sniff = Class::Sniff->new({
    class  => 'My::Class',
    ignore => qr/^DBIx::Class/,
 });

The constructor accepts a hashref with the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<class>

Mandatory.

The name of the class to sniff.  If the class is not loaded into memory, the
constructor will still work, but nothing will get reported.  You must ensure
that your class is already loaded!

If you pass it an instance of a class instead, it will call 'ref' on the class
to determine what class to use.

=item * C<ignore>

Optional.

This should be a regex telling C<Class::Sniff> what to ignore in class names.
This is useful if you're inheriting from a large framework and don't want to
report on it.  Be careful with this, though.  If you have a complicated
inheritance hierarchy and you try to ignore something other than the root, you
will likely get bad information returned.

=item * universal

Optional.

If present and true, will attempt to include the C<UNIVERSAL> base class.  If
a class hierarchy is pruned with C<ignore>, C<UNIVERSAL> may not show up.

=item * method_length

If present, will set the "maximum length" of a method before it's reported as
a code smell.  This feature is I<highly> experimental.  See C<long_methods>
for details.

sub new {
    my ( $class, $arg_for ) = @_;
    my $proto = $arg_for->{class}
      or Carp::croak("'class' argument not supplied to 'new'");
    my $target_class = ref $proto || $proto;
    if ( exists $arg_for->{ignore} && 'Regexp' ne ref $arg_for->{ignore} ) {
        Carp::croak("'ignore' requires a regex");
    }

 }

 # Print out the full inheritance heirarchy.

 my $graphviz = $graph->as_graphviz();
 open my $DOT, '|dot -Tpng -o graph.png' or die("Cannot open pipe to dot: $!");
 print $DOT $graphviz;

Given a namespace, returns a list of C<Class::Sniff> objects namespaces which
start with the C<$namespace> string.  Requires a C<namespace> argument.

All other arguments are passed to the C<Class::Sniff> constructor.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS - CODE SMELLS

=head2 C<overridden>

 my $overridden = $sniff->overridden;

This method returns a hash of arrays.  Each key is a method in the hierarchy
which has been overridden and the arrays are lists of all classes the method
is defined in (not just which one's it's overridden in).  The order of the
classes is in Perl's default inheritance search order.

=head3 Code Smell:  overridden methods

Overridden methods are not necessarily a code smell, but you should check them
to find out if you've overridden something you didn't expect to override.
Accidental overriding of a method can be very hard to debug.

This can also be a sign of bad responsibilities.  If you have a long
inheritance chain and you override a method in five different levels with five
different behaviors, perhaps this behavior should be in its own class.

=cut

sub overridden {
    my $self = shift;
    my %methods;
    while ( my ( $method, $classes ) = each %{ $self->{methods} } ) {
        $methods{$method} = $classes if @$classes > 1;
    }
    return \%methods;
}

=head2 C<exported>

    my $exported = $sniff->exported;

Returns a hashref of all classes which have subroutines exported into them.
The structure is:

 {
     $class1 => {
         $sub1 => $exported_from1,
         $sub2 => $exported_from2,
     },
     $class2 => { ... }
 }

Returns an empty hashref if no exported subs are found.

=head3 Code Smell:  exported subroutines

Generally speaking, you should not be exporting subroutines into OO code.
Quite often this happens with things like C<Carp::croak> and other modules
which export "helper" functions.  These functions may not behave like you
expect them to since they're generally not intended to be called as methods.

=cut

sub exported { $_[0]->{exported} }

=head2 C<unreachable>

 my @unreachable = $sniff->unreachable;
 for my $method (@unreachable) {
     print "Cannot reach '$method'\n";
 }

Returns a list of fully qualified method names (e.g.,
'My::Customer::_short_change') which are unreachable by Perl's normal search
inheritance search order.  It does this by searching the "paths" returned by
the C<paths> method.

=head3 Code Smell:  unreachable methods

Pretty straight-forward here.  If a method is unreachable, it's likely to be
dead code.  However, you might have a reason for this and maybe you're calling
it directly.

=cut

sub unreachable {
    my $self       = shift;
    my $overridden = $self->overridden;
    my @paths      = $self->paths;

    # If we only have one path through our code, we don't have any unreachable
    # methods.
    return if @paths == 1;

    # Algorithm:  If we have overridden methods, then if we have multiple
    # paths through the code, a method is unreachable if a *previous* path
    # contains the method because Perl's default search order won't get to
    # successive paths.
    my @unreachable;
    while ( my ( $method, $classes ) = each %$overridden ) {
        my @classes;

      CLASS:
        for my $class (@$classes) {
            my $method_found = 0;
            for my $path (@paths) {

                # method was found in a *previous* path.
                if ($method_found) {
                    push @unreachable => "$class\::$method";
                    next CLASS;
                }
                for my $curr_class (@$path) {
                    next CLASS if $curr_class eq $class;
                    if ( not $method_found && $curr_class->can($method) ) {
                        $method_found = 1;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return @unreachable;
}

=head2 C<paths>

 my @paths = $sniff->paths;

 for my $i (0 .. $#paths) {
     my $path = join ' -> ' => @{ $paths[$i] };
     printf "Path #%d is ($path)\n" => $i + 1;
 }

Returns a list of array references.  Each array reference is a list of
classnames representing the path Perl will take to search for a method.  For
example, if we have an abstract C<Animal> class and we use diamond inheritance
to create an C<Animal::Platypus> class, we might have the following hierarchy:

               Animal
              /      \
    Animal::Duck   Animal::SpareParts
              \      /
          Animal::Platypus

With Perl's normal left-most, depth-first search order, C<paths> will return:

 (
     ['Animal::Platypus', 'Animal::Duck',       'Animal'],
     ['Animal::Platypus', 'Animal::SpareParts', 'Animal'],
 )

If you are using a different MRO (Method Resolution Order) and you know your
search order is different, you can pass in a list of "correct" paths,
structured as above:

 # Look ma, one hand (er, path)!
 $sniff->paths( 
     ['Animal::Platypus', 'Animal::Duck', 'Animal::SpareParts', 'Animal'],
 );

At the present time, we do I<no> validation of what's passed in.  It's just an
experimental (and untested) hack.

=head3 Code Smell:  paths

Multiple inheritance paths are tricky to get right, make it easy to have
'unreachable' methods and have a greater cognitive load on the programmer.
For example, if C<Animal::Duck> and C<Animal::SpareParts> both define the same
method, C<Animal::SpareParts>' method is likely unreachable.  But what if
makes a required state change?  You now have broken code.

See L<http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/38373> for a more in-depth
explanation.

=cut

sub paths {
    my $self = shift;
    return @{ $self->{paths} } unless @_;
    $self->{paths} = [@_];
    return $self;
}

=head2 C<multiple_inheritance>

 my $num_classes = $sniff->multiple_inheritance;
 my @classes     = $sniff->multiple_inheritance;

Returns a list of all classes which inherit from more than one class.

=head3 Code Smell:  multiple inheritance

See the C<Code Smell> section for C<paths>

=cut

sub multiple_inheritance {
    my $self = shift;
    return grep { $self->parents($_) > 1 } $self->classes;
}

=head2 C<duplicate_methods>

B<Note>:  This method is very experimental and requires the L<B::Concise>
module.

 my $num_duplicates = $self->duplicate_methods;
 my @duplicates     = $self->duplicate_methods;

Returns either the number of duplicate methods found a list of array refs.
Each arrayref contains a list of array references, each having a class name
and method name.

B<Note>:  We report duplicates based on identical op-trees.  If the method
names are different or the variable names are different, that's OK.  Any
change to the op-tree, however, will break this.  The following two methods
are identical, even if they are in different packages.:

 sub inc {
    my ( $self, $value ) = @_;
    return $value + 1;
 }

 sub increment {
    my ( $proto, $number ) = @_;
    return $number + 1;
 }

However, this will not match the above methods:

 sub increment {
    my ( $proto, $number ) = @_;
    return 1 + $number;
 }

=head3 Code Smell:  duplicate methods

This is frequently a sign of "cut and paste" code.  The duplication should be
removed.  You may feel OK with this if the duplicated methods are exported
"helper" subroutines such as "Carp::croak".

=cut

sub duplicate_methods {
    my $self = shift;
    my @duplicates;
    foreach my $methods ( values %{ $self->{duplicates} } ) {
        if ( @$methods > 1 ) {
            push @duplicates => $methods;
        }
    }
    return @duplicates;
}

=head2 C<long_methods> (highly experimental)

 my $num_long_methods = $sniff->long_methods;
 my %long_methods     = $sniff->long_methods;

Returns methods longer than C<method_length>.  This value defaults to 50 and
can be overridden in the constructor (but not later).

Caveats:  this is experimental and depends on C<Sub::Information> 0.10 and the
ill-documented C<B> modules.  Specifically, it relies on the following:

=over 4

=item * How to count the length of a method.

 my $start_line = B::svref_2object($coderef)->START->line;
 my $end_line   = B::svref_2object($coderef)->GV->LINE;
 my $method_length = $end_line - $start_line;

The C<$start_line> returns the line number of the I<first expression> in the
subroutine, not the C<sub foo { ...> declaration.  The subroutine's
declaration actually ends at the ending curly brace, so the following method
would be considered 3 lines long, even though you might count it differently:

 sub new {
     # this is our constructor
     my ( $class, $arg_for ) = @_;
     my $self = bless {} => $class;
     return $self;
 }

=cut

sub long_methods { %{ $_[0]->{long_methods} } }

=item * Exported methods

These are simply ignored because the C<B> modules think they start and end in
different packages.

=item * Where does it really start?

If you've taken a reference to a method I<prior> to the declaration of the
reference being seen, Perl might report a negative length or simply blow up.
We trap that for you and you'll never see those.

=back

Let me know how it works out :)

=head3 Code Smell:  long methods

Long methods are probably doing to much and should be broken down into smaller
methods.  They're harder to follow, harder to debug, and if they're doing more
than one thing, you might find that you need that functionality elsewhere, but
now it's tightly coupled to the long method's behavior.  As always, use your
judgment.

=head2 C<parents>

 # defaults to 'target_class'
 my $num_parents = $sniff->parents;
 my @parents     = $sniff->parents;

 my $num_parents = $sniff->parents('Some::Class');
 my @parents     = $sniff->parents('Some::Class');

In scalar context, lists the number of parents a class has.

In list context, lists the parents a class has.

=head3 Code Smell:  multiple parens (multiple inheritance)

If a class has more than one parent, you may have unreachable or conflicting
methods.

=cut

sub parents {
    my ( $self, $class ) = @_;
    $class ||= $self->target_class;
    unless ( exists $self->{classes}{$class} ) {
        Carp::croak("No such class '$class' found in hierarchy");
    }
    return @{ $self->{classes}{$class}{parents} };
}

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS - REPORTING

=head2 C<report>

 print $sniff->report;

Prints out a detailed, human readable report of C<Class::Sniff>'s analysis of
the class.  Returns an empty string if no issues found.  Sample:

=head2 C<to_string>

 print $sniff->to_string;

For debugging, lets you print a string representation of your class hierarchy.
Internally this is created by L<Graph::Easy> and I can't figure out how to
force it to respect the order in which classes are ordered.  Thus, the
'left/right' ordering may be incorrect.

=cut

sub to_string { $_[0]->graph->as_ascii }

=head2 C<graph>

 my $graph = $sniff->graph;

Returns a C<Graph::Easy> representation of the inheritance hierarchy.  This is
exceptionally useful if you have C<GraphViz> installed.

 my $graph    = $sniff->graph;   # Graph::Easy
 my $graphviz = $graph->as_graphviz();
 open my $DOT, '|dot -Tpng -o graph.png' or die("Cannot open pipe to dot: $!");
 print $DOT $graphviz;

Visual representations of complex hierarchies are worth their weight in gold.
See L<http://pics.livejournal.com/publius_ovidius/pic/00015p9z>.

Because I cannot figure force it to respect the 'left/right' ordering of
classes, you may need to manually edit the C<$graphviz> data to get this
right.

=head2 C<combine_graphs>

Allows you to create a large inheritance hierarchy graph by combining several

Returns a L<Graph::Easy> object.

This is the value provided (if any) to the 'universal' parameter in the
constructor.  If it's a true value, 'UNIVERSAL' will be added to the
hierarchy.  If the hierarchy is pruned via 'ignore' and we don't get down that
far in the hierarchy, the 'UNIVERSAL' class will not be added.

=head1 CAVEATS AND PLANS

=over 4

=item * Package Variables

User-defined package variables in OO code are a code smell, but with versions
of Perl < 5.10, any subroutine also creates a scalar glob entry of the same
name, so I've no done a package variable check yet.  This will happen in the
future (there will be exceptions, such as with @ISA).

=item * C3 Support

I'd like support for alternate method resolution orders.  If your classes use
C3, you may get erroneous results.  See L<paths> for a workaround.
