* Circular inheritance?
* Add support for reporting classes found more than once in a tree.
* Add C3 support?
* User-defined package variables (tough to do because pre 5.10 we have scalars
  reported with the same name as subs).
* Ambiguous methods (Foo::Bar->baz can be interpreted as Foo::Bar()->baz)
* Add paths() validation
* Make methods more cohesive.
